# Lib's - Keystone Roulette

**Can't decide which key to run? Let the wheel decide!**

A fun spinning wheel that randomly picks a keystone from your party. No more arguments about whose key to push!

## How It Works

1. Type `/ksr` to open the wheel
2. All party keystones appear on the wheel
3. Hit **SPIN**
4. The wheel picks your next dungeon!

## Features

- **Spinning Wheel** - Watch keystones spin around until one is chosen
- **Party Keystones** - Automatically detects keystones from everyone in your group
- **Chat Announcement** - Optionally announce the winner in party chat
- **Minimap Button** - Quick access from your minimap
- **Customizable** - Adjust spin duration (1-30 seconds)

## Commands

| Command        | Description    |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| `/ksr`         | Open the wheel |
| `/ksr options` | Open settings  |

## Options

- **Spin Duration** - How long the wheel spins (default: 5 seconds)
- **Announce Winner** - Post result to party chat (default: on)
- **Minimap Button** - Show/hide the minimap icon

## Requirements

- Works standalone - no other addons required
- Keystone sharing works best when party members have addons using LibOpenRaid (Details!, MDT, etc.)

## FAQ

**Q: Why don't I see my party's keystones?**
A: Keystone sharing requires LibOpenRaid communication. If party members have Details! or similar addons, it should work automatically.

**Q: Can I test it without a keystone?**
A: Yes! Type `/ksr test` to enable test mode with fake data.
